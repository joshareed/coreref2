	"description": "The key aim of the MIS Project is to determine past ice shelf responses to climate forcing, including variability at a range of timescales. To achieve this aim ANDRILL will recover core from beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf. The primary target for the MIS site is a 1200 meter-thick body of Plio-Pleistocene (0-5 million years ago) glacimarine, terrigenous, volcanic, and biogenic sediment that has accumulated in the Windless Bight region of a flexural moat basin surrounding Ross Island. A single ~1000 meter-deep drillcore will be recovered from approximately 900m of water.",
